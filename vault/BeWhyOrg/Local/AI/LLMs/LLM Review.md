# Introduction

Welcome to LLM World, we needed some better Obsidian Graph, less files; all this is good mental Gymnastics just to plan. Love it!

We are dividing into 2 groups. The ones we can run locally and will have more info, as the one that can only be by API requests, therefor payed. Reminder to add 

The only that says in the middle so far is [[Claude.ai]] for being the father of MCPs, and have monitor him. Honor mention to Grok3, and it's WebUi. [[Google Review]] Freemium tools also can have data to explore

## Local LLM

### [[Alibaba Qwen]]
### [[DeepSeek]]
### [[Falcon]]
### [[French Mistral]]
### [[Google Gemma]]
### [[Meta LLama]]
### [[Microsoft Phi]]

### Forgotten Models to Consider

You asked about additional models worth exploring. Here are a few that could fit your 6GB and 16GB ranges:
- Mistral 3B (if available): A smaller variant of Mistral, potentially fitting within 2–4GB (INT8), though less common.
- Grok (xAI): Parameter size varies, but smaller versions might fit 16GB setups—check Ollama for availability.

These could expand your options, especially if you explore Ollama’s library or other model hubs.


## API LLM

### Google Gemini

- Availability: [Free tier via Google AI Studio]([https://ai.google.dev/pricing](aistudio.google.com)).
* Free up to 15 requests per minute. After that, billing depends on prompt size. [For more info, see pricing details.](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)
- Status: Offers the “most free API” (15 requests/minute via Google AI Studio), but you’ve hit 503 errors, and it’s not reliable.
- Local Deployment: Not possible—Gemini models are proprietary.
- Priority: Low. You’re likely to drop Gemini due to its unreliability and lack of local deployment options.

### xAi

- Status: API access only, paid (no free tier). xAI offers Grok-2-latest, but it’s not open-source.
- Local Deployment: Not possible—Grok models are proprietary.
### OpenAi

- Status: API access only, paid (free tier is too limited, e.g., 200K tokens/day). Last on your list due to its restrictions.
- Local Deployment: Not possible—GPT models are proprietary.
- Priority: Low. You’ll drop OpenAI as it doesn’t align with your local deployment goal.

## Super Agents?

I know there are more, to start gather references:
