For your setup with Ollama models on a GTX 1660 SUPER, I'd recommend starting with a text-generation web UI like **text-generation-webui** (often called "oobabooga"). Starting with [[Ollama]]

Here's why it would be better than Misty for your initial exploration:

1. **Greater flexibility with models** - It works well with all the models you listed (Phi-3 Mini, Gemma 2B, Qwen, Mistral, LLaMA)
2. **Better integration with Ollama** - Has specific support for connecting to your existing Ollama setup
3. **More customization options** - Offers extensive fine-tuning of generation parameters, context windows, etc.
4. **Active community support** - Larger user base means more troubleshooting resources available
5. **Gradio interface** - Provides an intuitive UI that's easier to work with for beginners

You can set it up with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui
cd text-generation-webui
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py --listen --extensions api
```

Then configure it to connect to your Ollama instance. This gives you a solid playground for testing different models before you commit to deeper Obsidian integration.

If you find text-generation-webui too complex, you could try Misty later as a simpler alternative, but the web UI gives you more room to experiment initially.
