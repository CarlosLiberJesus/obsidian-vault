# Task Creation Tutorial: Managing Code Interventions with LLMs

## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to create tasks in Obsidian for managing code interventions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Effective task management is crucial for ensuring the quality and maintainability of code generated or modified by LLMs.

## Prerequisites

*   Obsidian
*   Obsidian Tasks plugin

## Creating a Basic Task

The Obsidian Tasks plugin uses a simple syntax for creating tasks:

```
- [ ] My task description
```

This will create a task with the description "My task description".

## Adding Context to Tasks

To add context to a task, you can link to relevant files or notes using Obsidian's linking syntax:

```
- [ ] Review generated code [[MyFile.js]]
```

You can also add tags to tasks to categorize them:

```
- [ ] Test code change #testing #code
```

## Using Tasks for Code Interventions

Here are some examples of how to use tasks to manage code interventions with LLMs:

*   **Creating a task to review generated code:**

```
- [ ] Review generated code from LLM [[MyFile.js]] #review #llm
```

*   **Creating a task to test a code change:**

```
- [ ] Test code change implemented by LLM [[MyFile.js]] #testing #llm
```

*   **Creating a task to document a code change:**

```
- [ ] Document code change implemented by LLM [[MyFile.js]] #documentation #llm
```

## Advanced Task Management

You can use task dependencies to specify the order in which tasks should be completed:

```
- [ ] Implement code change [[MyFile.js]]
    - [ ] Test code change #testing #llm ^depends(Implement code change)
```

You can also use task priorities to indicate the importance of tasks:

```
- [ ] Review generated code from LLM [[MyFile.js]] #review #llm ^priority(high)
