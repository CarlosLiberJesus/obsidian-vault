# Introduction

Claude.ai is build by Antropic, so sometimes terms can be used sometimes as the same. Do not confuse withe Cline which is a plugin.

So far the one I'm most inclined to pay, since they are the parents of MCP.

Homepage to Api: https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard
Homepage to Chat: https://claude.ai/

Its API access is never free (for now), minimum of 5€.

## Short

- Status: API access only, paid (e.g., $3/million input tokens). Anthropic is the “father of MCP” (they created the Model Context Protocol), so you want to keep checking their developments.
- Local Deployment: Not possible—Claude models are proprietary and not open-source.
- Priority: Low for local deployment, but high for MCP knowledge (e.g., their WebCrawler MCP server). You’ll monitor Anthropic for MCP advancements but won’t use Claude for local testing.
